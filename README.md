### Intro

This project is born from multiple discussions where RxSwift was picked over other FRP frameworks. The main, sometimes only, reasoning was "but the android team uses RxJava". 
My personal and honest feelings about RxSwift, is that it has advantages over ReactiveSwift, but I find that most of the times people adopt RxSwift for two main reasons:

1. Cargo cult.
2. "but the android team uses RxJava".wefwefew

Which, has you might suspect, are bad arguments.  

### FAQ

#### What is this then?

In a nutshell, provide the same API as RxSwift, using ReactiveSwift underneath.

#### Why?

Because I have too much time in my hands. 

#### No really, why?

This is a parody, so it's fine. I also wanted to use this gif when comparing this project to RxSwift:
